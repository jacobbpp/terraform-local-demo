# A Demonstration of Local Terraform

This repository provides a **clean, cloud-free introduction to Terraform**, perfect for learning the fundamentals of Infrastructure as Code (IaC) without needing AWS, Azure, or GCP credentials.

Itâ€™s designed for students, educators, and anyone new to Terraform who wants to explore:

## What Youâ€™ll Learn

This demonstration covers the **core lifecycle methods** in Terraform:

- `terraform init` â€“ Initialises your project and downloads any required providers  
- `terraform validate` â€“ Checks for syntax and configuration errors  
- `terraform plan` â€“ Shows what Terraform *will do* before it does it  
- `terraform apply` â€“ Provisions infrastructure (in this case, a simple local resource)

Youâ€™ll also understand the **structure of IaC projects**, including:

- **Providers** â€“ These define *where* and *how* infrastructure will be provisioned  
- **Resources** â€“ These are the *things* Terraform manages (servers, files, commands)  
- **Outputs** â€“ These provide usable values from your infrastructure (e.g. IPs, URLs)

## Why This Is Useful

Infrastructure as Code is a key part of DevOps, but getting started often requires cloud access, credentials, and billing accounts. This project removes those barriers.

By using the `null_resource` and `local-exec` provisioner, youâ€™ll:

- Learn how Terraform works **without provisioning anything in the cloud**  
- Focus entirely on Terraformâ€™s workflow, language, and automation concepts  
- See how Terraform integrates seamlessly into a **CI pipeline** using GitHub Actions  
- Understand how pipelines automate infrastructure provisioning and change tracking

---

## How It Works

When you push changes to this repo:

1. GitHub Actions automatically runs the Terraform workflow
2. Terraform initialises the project
3. It validates the syntax
4. It plans what it will do (create a fake resource)
5. It applies that plan and runs a simple `echo` command

No cloud credentials, no bills, no risk, just the fundamentals.

## Great for Learning

This is an ideal starting point before progressing to:

- Cloud-based provisioning (AWS, Azure, GCP)
- Terraform modules and remote backends
- State management and collaboration practices
- Real-world DevOps pipelines that deploy live infrastructure

---

## ðŸ“‚ Getting Started

To explore this locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/terraform-local-demo.git
cd terraform-local-demo
terraform init
terraform validate
terraform plan
terraform apply
```
You'll see a message like:
*Provisioning step complete â€“ no cloud involved!*

## Want to Extend it?

Try adding:
- A second null_resource to simulate dependencies
- Outputs that return messages from your fake infrastructure
- A GitHub Actions job for terraform destroy
- PR triggers and approval steps to simulate production workflow
